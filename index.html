		<p>Earlier this year, my wife and I had the opportunity to visit Charleston, South Carolina. The trip was a first for both of us, and it certainly won't be our last time. We loved the old, Southern charm and are excited for the next time we can explore the town further.</p>

			<h2>Our Accomodations</h2>

			<p>While in Charleston, we used Airbnb for the first time and it sure worked out. We stayed a historic home that included old furniture that looked like it may have been there for the last hundred years. The best part was a porch on the second floor that overlooked a beautiful garden and the street on which the property was located. Our hostess was incredibly hospitable and was helpful with recommendations for our visit.</p>

			<h2>Activities</h2>

			<p>While in Charleston, we visited Fort Sumter, went to the beach and generally relaxed. I am history buff, though, so my favorite part was touring an old aircraft carrier. It was complete with helicopters, fighter jets and even a submarine used during WWII. The above picture is of my wife and on the the deck of the carrier.</p>

			<h2>Restaurants</h2>

			<p>The food in Charleston is amazing, in large part due to its proximity to the water. There is great seafood to be had almost anywhere you turn. Our favorite restaurant was one that had come highly recommended by friends and family: Husk. Husk is a farm-to-table type of dining establishment with an ever changing menu. It did not disappoint.</p>
